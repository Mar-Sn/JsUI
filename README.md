# JsUi
This library will help greatly with development when 
constructing a UI with javascript. Currently the library contains
the following elements:
- Button
- Input
- Fieldset (with input)
- Table
- Grid layout
- Panel
- Popup

## Requirements

- Node package manager (NPM)
- Optional gulp installed globally

## How to use
The design of the library is that you can (mostly) choose what 
you want to use in terms of imports. Use npm to download dependencies
followed by `gulp build`. Use requirejs to define and use the components.

Please see index.html in test for examples.
